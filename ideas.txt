Concepts


Have layered rectangles
    if rectangles collide with enemy unit
            unit fires pre-determined bullet patterns
    end

    if enemy collides with player bullets
            enemy puu-chuns(dies) and is removed from table
    end

    if enemy collides with player
            player health goes down
    end

    enemy will continue to move downwards until it goes past screen

    not killing an enemy counts against points, but maybe doesn't take the point counter down
    oh yeah lets make a point counter

    enemy bullet touches player, player dies
